# MyServer with MongoDB and Express

Welcome to MyServer, a Node HTTP server application designed for managing evacuation plans. This version has been modified to use MongoDB as the database and Express.js as the server.

## Features

- **Create Evacuation Plans:** Add new evacuation plans, specifying details such as name, location, and additional information.

- **Read Evacuation Plans:** Retrieve information about all plans or access details for a specific plan based on its unique identifier.

- **Update Evacuation Plans:** Modify the details of an existing plan, ensuring that the information remains up-to-date.

- **Delete Evacuation Plans:** Permanently remove plans from the system when they are no longer relevant.

- **Routing:** Basic routing mechanisms are implemented to handle HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

- **Data Storage:** Evacuation plans are stored in a MongoDB database. The server supports CRUD operations to effectively manage these plans.
